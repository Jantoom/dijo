# Dijo (Digital Bullet Journal)

## Deployment

To deploy, add your credentials to project-23-dijo/code and run terraform apply in the project-23-dijo/code/infrastructure directory.

## Abstract

We are transitioning into a digital age, with paper calendars and dairies being a thing of the past. Despite this transition into a digital age, the bullet journalling community continues to remain analog. [Bullet journalling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyDyFsoU04k), often called Bujo, is essentially regular journaling without the restrictions.

So why do applications such as [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) fail to accomodate the bujo community? One clear reason is the app limitations (font, text placement, colours , etc) causing it to not be fully personalisable. Another reason is the lack of community. The Bujo community primarily consists of artists and stationery addicts. Moving digitally will remove the novelty of buying stationery (such as stickers or stamps) from businesses such as independent artist.

To address this, Dijo plans to be a secure cross-platform digital journal integrated with a marketplace where artists or users can upload digital assets or designs.
